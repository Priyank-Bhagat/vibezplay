🎥 You can add video content by clicking on the plus icon ➕ in the navigation bar.
Then click on the add video button 📹, select source 📂, and then select or capture video 📷.
After that, add the song name 🎵 and caption 📝, and then click on upload 🚀.
Your content will be uploaded. 🎉

I've also implemented compression of video size to take less space on the server and can easily load up when needed.
